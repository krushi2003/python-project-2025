# Python-Project-2025
* Project Name : Snake and Apple Game
* Introduction :
  - The existing system for the Snake and Apple game is a simple yet engaging arcade-style game developed using Python, commonly utilizing the pygame library for     
  graphics and user interaction.
  - The game operates on a grid-based structure where the player controls a snake that moves in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. The primary 
  objective is to navigate the snake toward an apple, which appears randomly on the screen.
  - Upon consuming the apple, the snake grows in length, increasing the game's difficulty as movement becomes more challenging in the confined space. 
  The system continuously checks for collisions, ensuring that if the snake hits the screen boundaries or its own body, the game ends.
